# Welcome to Congruence Engine investigations


These are experimental, work-in-progress, mainly proof-of-concept investigations using digital tools and computational technologies and aiming to bring together multiple archive, museum, personal, and heritage UK collections with industrial history focus. 


These have been developed as part of the [AHRC](https://www.ukri.org/councils/ahrc/) -  [TaNC](https://www.nationalcollection.org.uk)-funded Congruence Engine project, which focused, among other things, on exploring what a UK collection of industrial heritage materials might look like.
